# Strands

[x] Filter by adjacent bitmasks (did not improve performance)
[x] Update validity matrix for trapped nodes (implemented with span + bm_i + bm_j)
[x] Track visited combinations with trie of visited subsets (no improvement)
[x] Merge isolated zones
[ ] Sort bitmasks by size (doubtful but easy to try)
[ ] Convert into minimal set cover problem using embedding distance (involves semantics - no longer a "blind solve")
[ ] Refactoring and readability improvements
